#dear-souvenirs

I had a friend in Umeå, a photographer, that stored all his pictures on Flickr,
and some one Facebook. There were over 2200 pictures, no way I download them one
by one with the 'save as' method. 

This script allows you to download an entire Flickr album's high resolution 
picture by just inputing the album's URL. 

You need awk, nodejs, and wget to use it.
