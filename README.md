#dear-souvenirs

I had a friend in Ume√•, a photographer, that stored all his pictures on Flickr,
and some one Facebook. There were over 2200 pictures, no way I download them one
by one with the 'save as' method. 

This script allows you to download an entire Flickr album's high resolution 
picture by just inputing the album's URL.
